PROJECT #2 README.TXT

Hi!

This project is a modular distance vector simulation across 5 routers (A,B,C,D,E), the given configurations are input via the "test" directory files.

1) To compile my project simply execute the cc.sh script in the local directory to create executable ./router
2) To run test, run the script t1.cc (make sure the test directory is included and router exists)
3) BE AFRAID AS TERMINALS COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK, just kidding, but terminals should be instantiated for each router in the test
4) Routers will remain active (and continue producing timeout updating messaging) until manually closed


Thanks, Enjoy!
