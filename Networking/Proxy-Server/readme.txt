Hi!

This is a very simple proxy server done in C.

Steps required to setup proxy:
1) On your browser enable manual proxy via network settings
2) Host = localhost, Port = 1234 (You can change this if you wish via defined constant PORT in proxy.c)
3) Remember to clear cache history on browser for fresh retrieval from server!
4) in terminal (and local directory of project) execute: make
5) Run proxy program via ./proxy - Should see a welcome message
6) Return to your web-browser and begin to input URLs

Thanks and Enjoy!
